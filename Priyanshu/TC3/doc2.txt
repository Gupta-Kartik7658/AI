The team then created artificial intelligence agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning and trained them on a similar cooperation task in a virtual environment. This parallel approach allowed direct comparison of how biological and artificial systems learn cooperative behavior.
Mice successfully learned to coordinate their action and gain mutual reward. Mice developed three key behavioral strategies: approaching their partner's side of the chamber, waiting for their partner to arrive before nose-poking, and engaging in mutual interactions prior to making decisions. These behaviors increased substantially during training, with interaction behavior more than doubling as mice became more skilled at cooperation.
The research revealed that neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex encoded these cooperative behaviors and decision-making processes, with animals showing better cooperative performance having stronger neural representations of their partner's information. Remarkably, when researchers inhibited ACC activity, cooperation decreased substantially, proving this brain region is essential for coordinated behavior.
