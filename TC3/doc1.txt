Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) learn by training on a set of data. For example, to teach an ANN to recognize a cat, we show it thousands of images of cats. The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.
Once the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The networkâ€™s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.
This process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error. Essentially, through constant training and feedback, the network becomes better at identifying patterns and making predictions.
