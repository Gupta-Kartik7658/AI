Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computer systems designed to mimic how the human brain processes information. Just like the brain uses neurons to process data and make decisions, ANNs use artificial neurons to analyze data, identify patterns and make predictions. These networks consist of layers of interconnected neurons that work together to solve complex problems. The key idea is that ANNs can "learn" from the data they process, just as our brain learns from experience. They are used in various applications from recognizing images to making personalized recommendations. In this article, we will see more about ANNs, how they function and other core concepts.
